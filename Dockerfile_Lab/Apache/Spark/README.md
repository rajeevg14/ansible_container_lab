## Data Mechanics Example Repository

This repository contains example deployment scenarios, configurations and tooling for running Spark on Kuberentes. The projects may include full or partial application code, and some have accompanying blog posts, which you can find here - https://www.datamechanics.co/blog. 

Some projects may be designed to executed on the Data Mechanics platform, but feel free to edit the code so you can run on your local Docker environment or Kubernetes cluster. 

Our fleet of [Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/datamechanics/spark) are publicly available, as well as our open soure monitoring tool [Delight](https://www.datamechanics.co/delight).
